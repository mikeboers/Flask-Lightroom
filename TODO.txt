- include "type=photo" or "type=collection"
- publish collections

- How to deal with photos being in several collections? Are the IDs
  stored per-collection? Is our extra metadata stored per-collection or
  per photo?

- Add several signing methods:
    - Old-style FLickr API, but with HMAC instead
    - Oauth

- Allow metadata to be renamed: "keywords=keywordTags"

- Should I start defining a real API (based on JSON) or should I keep it
  as generic as possible? Since anyone using this will likely need to do
  some custom coding on the server side, it isn't a huge stretch to make
  it use JSON, or whatever. Interaction with other existing services
  will likely have their own plugins.
